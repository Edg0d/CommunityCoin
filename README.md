# Communities

## Overview

Communities is a social platform that allows users to create and join communities based on specific interests or topics, post and comment on content, and collaborate to make decisions on what content belongs where. The platform utilizes a blockchain to track user actions and distribute rewards for interaction.

## Features

- Create and join communities: Users can create their own communities and search for and join existing communities.
- Post and comment on content: Users can create and post content, such as text, images, and videos, within the communities they have joined. They can also view and comment on content posted by other users.
- Collaborative decision-making: Community members can vote on which content belongs where, or which content should be removed, through a decentralized voting system built on the blockchain.
- Rewards for interaction: Users are awarded tokens or coins for participating in the community, which can be used for voting on content or other activities on the platform.

## Technical Requirements

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Solidity (for smart contract development)
- Web3.js (for interaction with the blockchain)
